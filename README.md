# Analyzing-Used-Car-Listings-on-eBay-Kleinanzeigen

I'll will be working on a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The version of the dataset I'll be working with is a sample of 50,000 data points. 

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.
